All music is copyright © Lucky Lion Studios.

Upon purchasing a song from the Royalty-Free Video Game Music Library, you are granted the non-transferable right to use the music in your commercial or noncommercial production.

You are also permitted to make adjustments to the file in order to increase or decrease the overall volume, adjust the loop or change file types. Changes or additions to the composition of the song, however, are not permitted without the prior approval of Lucky Lion Studios. This includes adding vocals or creating remixes.

You are not permitted to resell the music as a music-only product. The music must be used as an accompaniment to the main production (video games, film, digital presentations or applications, etc).

You may not trade, duplicate or transfer the music except to incorporate it into your production. You may not offer the music as a stand-alone download, ringtone or audio CD.
